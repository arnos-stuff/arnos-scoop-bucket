# Convert HTML to PDF using Chrome

This is a simple script to convert HTML to PDF using Chrome. It uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) under the hood.

This is useful whenever *like me* you've

* tried to use [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) and failed miserably
* noticed that your HTML is *rendering perfectly* in Chrome but not using wkhtmltopdf

**Note:** This is just a [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) package for [ChromeHtmlToPdf](https://github.com/Sicos1977/ChromeHtmlToPdf) which wasn't written by me. I just wanted to make it easier to install. A huge thanks to [Sicos1977](https://github.com/Sicos1977) and others who have contributed to this project.

## Installation

This will come soon :heart:
